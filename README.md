## 🧭 Project Objectives

### Present a stakeholder-focused presentation that simulates real-world decision-making scenarios and provides the following structure:
- Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 309 patient records containing 15 lifestyle, health, and symptom variables to identify patterns associated with lung cancer risk.

- **Model Development — Supervised Machine Learning:**
  - Build and evaluate multiple supervised learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict lung cancer likelihood based on patient features.
  - Use 5-Fold Cross Validation to ensure model robustness and reliability.
  - Compare model performance using ROC curves, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Identify the best-performing model for interpretability, sensitivity, and real-world deployment.

- **Key Findings & Insights:**
  - Logistic Regression achieved an AUC of 0.951 and 85% recall, making it highly interpretable and suitable for clinical trust.
  - Random Forest achieved an AUC of 0.949 and 94% recall, showing stronger sensitivity for early detection.

## 🧩 Project Description
The Lung Cancer Detection Project aims to develop a **supervised machine learning** system capable of predicting an individual’s risk of lung cancer based on their lifestyle habits, health history, and symptom indicators.

Using a dataset of 309 records and 15 key features, the project applies both baseline models (Logistic Regression) and ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to identify high-risk individuals early—before severe symptoms appear. Through careful data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation, the system demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance clinical decision-making and improve global health outcomes.

The project simulates a real-world public health scenario where AI tools support medical professionals and policymakers (e.g., World Health Organisation) by:
- Detecting early-stage risk patterns that are often missed during traditional check-ups.
- Reducing diagnostic delays and human error through AI-assisted predictive analytics.
- Providing transparent, interpretable predictions to guide preventive screening and resource allocation.

Ultimately, this project showcases how machine learning-driven diagnostics can save lives by enabling early detection, timely intervention, and data-informed health policy—bridging the gap between technology and global healthcare impact.
